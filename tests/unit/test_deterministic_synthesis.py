"""
Regression tests for deterministic project synthesis.

The synthesiser is what lets the agent build working software when no model
provider is reachable. Every case here is a real generated project: the code must
compile, the project's own test suite must pass, and the features the goal asked
for must actually be present. No mocks -- the generated files are written to a
real temp directory and executed with a real interpreter.

# Finding 21: the "contact" library entity's `search()` function used
# `json.dumps(...)` but the module never actually imported `json` -- a prior
# fix for this had patched `import json` into the generated source as plain
# text spliced into index 3 of the output lines, which happened to land
# *inside the module's docstring* rather than becoming a real import
# statement, so every "contact" library crashed on its only exported
# function with `NameError: name 'json' is not defined`. This slipped past
# the existing CASES list above because it only ever exercised the "string"
# and "number" library entities -- none of the other eleven entity-specific
# code paths in `_lib_main` (note/todo/book/contact/expense/event/file/user/
# password/url/recipe/habit) were ever generated-and-executed by a test.
#
# This sweep closes that coverage gap for good: it builds a goal for every
# entity the generator recognises (mirroring the real keyword signals in
# `DOMAIN_SIGNALS` / `ENTITY_SIGNALS`), actually generates the library, and
# runs its own bundled test suite with a real interpreter -- the same
# "no mocks, real execution" standard the CASES list already holds the
# CLI/API/script/website kinds to.
