"""
Regression tests for two silent-data-loss bugs in the deterministic Script
generator (`_script_main` in app/agents/synthesis.py), found by actually
generating a script and running it against real files on disk -- not by
reading the source or trusting the generated project's own test suite
(which asserted on the *happy path* only and could not have caught either
bug, since both only manifest with inputs the original tests never tried).

Finding 18 -- `rename_lower` silently destroyed a file on a case collision:
    Two differently-cased files in one directory (e.g. README.MD and
    readme.md) both normalize to the same lowercase target. The generated
    code called `path.rename(target)` unconditionally, and `Path.rename()`
    silently overwrites an existing destination on POSIX. Live repro: a
    directory with A.txt, README.MD, and readme.md went from 3 files to 2
    after `rename --apply` -- readme.md's original content was gone, with
    no error and an exit code of 0. The CLI's own success message also said
    "file(s) would be renamed" even when `--apply` was passed and files were
    actually renamed, which would have made the data loss even harder to
    notice.

Finding 20 -- `json_to_csv` corrupted its output on inconsistent rows and
crashed with a raw traceback on non-dict array items:
    `fieldnames` was taken only from the first row's keys, so a later row
    with an extra key (a very common shape for loosely-structured JSON
    exports) made `csv.DictWriter.writerows` raise partway through --
    *after* the header and every prior row had already been written
    straight to the target file, leaving a truncated, silently corrupted
    CSV on disk despite the command reporting an error and a non-zero exit
    code. Separately, a non-dict item in the JSON array (e.g. a bare
    string) raised an unhandled `AttributeError: 'str' object has no
    attribute 'keys'` with a raw internal traceback instead of a clean,
    actionable error message.

Finding 19 -- `backup_today` silently lost a file to a flattening collision:
    `source.rglob("*")` walks subdirectories, but every match was copied to
    `target / path.name` -- a flat basename-only destination. Two files with
    the same name in different subdirectories (e.g. sub1/data.txt and
    sub2/data.txt) collided on the same flat destination, and the second
    `shutil.copy2()` silently overwrote the first. Live repro: backing up a
    tree containing both files reported "copied 2 file(s)" (i.e. claimed
    full success) while the backup folder only ever contained one data.txt,
    with the other file's content permanently gone from the backup.
