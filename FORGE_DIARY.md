## 📖 Daily Summaries

### 🚀 [Day 1 — August 25, 2026: Inception & Complete Engine Build](diary/2026-08-25.md)

Today I built the core foundation of FORGE from scratch as a 100% standalone product.

**What I accomplished today:**
- **Isolated Workspaces:** Created sandboxes for every task to keep project files, test artifacts, and build logs isolated and safe.
- **Deterministic State Machine:** Built an 8-state task lifecycle in SQLite with checkpoints so long tasks can pause, resume, or recover from crashes.
- **10 Specialist Agent Roles:** Defined distinct engineering roles—from Architects and Full-Stack Developers to QA Testers, Security Reviewers, and Release Engineers.
- **Parallel Task Waves:** Added asynchronous scheduling so independent tasks (like frontend and backend synthesis) run simultaneously.
- **Real Verification & Browser Testing:** Built automated verification checks with Python AST compilers, Ruff linting, Pytest test suites, and Playwright headless Chromium browser checks with screenshot capture.
- **Self-Healing Recovery Loop:** Implemented root-cause debugging with anti-loop retry limits and patch hashing so it never gets stuck in infinite repair loops.
- **Standalone CLI & Golden Benchmarks:** Built the `forge build` command-line interface and verified it against 3 real-world benchmark projects (a Python CLI tool, a FastAPI backend service, and a responsive website).
- **Delivery Packaging:** Added automated completion reports (`completion_report.json` and `COMPLETION_REPORT.md`) and signed git release tagging (`v1.0-forge-delivery`).
- **Verification Integrity:** Verified 100% test assertions without mocks or stubs in production paths.

**Outcome:** 61/61 automated tests passing (100% clean baseline).

### 🧠 [Day 2 — August 26, 2026: AI Universe Peer Reasoning, Multi-File Synthesis & Strict Verification](diary/2026-08-26.md)

Today I integrated Project FORGE with the external "AI Universe" multi-agent reasoning system running locally at `http://localhost:8000`, upgraded the engine to support end-to-end multi-file project generation, and implemented strict objective verification with fallback failure enforcement.

**What I accomplished today:**
- **AI Universe Client (`app/integrations/`):** Built an asynchronous `httpx` client supporting `ask()` and `debate()` endpoints with `X-FRIDAY-API-Key` header authentication, optimized connection timeouts, and structured `AIUniverseResponse` modeling.
- **Trust-But-Verify Logic:** Implemented the `consult_with_verification()` mechanism that verifies calibrated confidence scores (>= 0.70 threshold) before accepting consensus, falling back to internal reasoning if confidence is low.
- **Multi-File File Manifests (`app/agents/roles.py`):** Upgraded `ArchitectRole` to generate a structured `docs/FILE_MANIFEST.json` list of required project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, etc.) alongside `docs/ARCHITECTURE_SPEC.md`.
- **Developer Multi-File Manifest Iteration (`app/agents/roles.py`):** Configured `DeveloperRole` to iterate through the File Manifest, calling AI Universe per file with `"Write the complete code for {filename} based on the overall architecture: {goal}. Return ONLY the raw code."`, writing each distinct file directly into `project/`.
- **Human-Readable Task IDs & Clean Workspace Directories:** Formatted sequential task identifiers (`task01<DDMMYYYY><HHMMSS>`) with clean workspace directory mappings (`workspaces/task0126082026113542`).
- **Strict Objective Verification Battery & Fallback Gating (`app/verification/` & `app/core/`):** Implemented `FeaturePresenceChecker` to verify that requested libraries and frontend components are actually implemented in project files, rejecting untouched template stubs. If AI Universe fails and the system falls back to stub generation, `DeveloperRole` flags `state/FALLBACK_STUB.json`, `OrchestratorCore` sets `TaskState.FAILED`, and the CLI displays a red warning banner.
- **Multi-File Verification Battery:** Enhanced `BuildChecker` with `HTMLParser` syntax validation and `LintChecker` with static web asset and CSS bracket linting.
- **Evidence-First Guarantee:** Zero model self-reporting; all completion decisions are grounded in objective execution evidence.
- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Authored unit and golden benchmark tests covering all integration paths, resulting in 128 passing tests.

**Outcome:** 128/128 automated tests passing (100% clean).

- **Production Hardening & Rate Limiting (`app/security/`):** Added sliding-window rate limiting (100 req/hr + 2x burst), token rotation, and failed attempt rate-limiting.
- **Prometheus Monitoring & Diagnostics (`app/monitoring/`):** Exposed `/metrics`, configured real-time latency/error rate tracking, host resource meters (CPU/RAM/Disk), and health probes (`/health`, `/health/ready`, `/health/detailed`).
- **Disaster Recovery Backups (`app/backup/`):** Built automated 6-hour SQLite snapshot backups with workspace metadata exports and 7-day retention pruning.
- **Deployment Packaging:** Formulated multi-stage Dockerfile, docker-compose, Kubernetes manifests, systemd service, and GZip/WAL performance tuning.
- **Automated Delivery & Web Dashboard:** Integrated automated GitHub repository/release publishing and an interactive web management dashboard with 8-stage timeline visualization.
- **Consumer-Agnostic Core:** Enforced zero caller coupling with dynamic webhook dispatching exclusively via caller payload URLs.

**Outcome:** 182/182 automated tests passing (100% clean baseline).

### 🔧 [Day 8 — September 1, 2026: Comprehensive Project Audit, Bug Hunt, and Engine Upgrade](diary/2026-09-01.md)

Today I executed a comprehensive, 10-phase engineering audit and code quality upgrade across the entire Project FORGE codebase, fixing all discovered edge cases, timezone bugs, authentication contract issues, and linter violations.

**What I accomplished today:**
- **Phase 1 Bug Hunt & Real-World Defect Resolution:** Fixed `verify_ws_auth()` in `app/api/websocket.py` to authenticate all ecosystem API keys (`forge_api`, `friday_api`, `inference_api`, `friday_universe_api`), resolving WebSocket 1008 disconnects. Updated `handle_build()` in `app/cli.py` to return the synthesized `TaskEntity` for deterministic lookup by ID. Standardized naive `datetime.now()` calls in `models.py` and `tasks.py` to timezone-aware `datetime.now(UTC)`.
- **Phase 2 & 3 Error Handling, Edge Cases & Security Audits:** Audited all external clients (`ai_universe_client`, `intelx_client`, `futuris_client`, `cortex_client`) for timeouts, retries, and fallback handling. Verified sandbox containment in `WorkspaceManager`, parameterized SQL queries in `StateStore`, and token redaction in `AuditLogger`.
- **Phase 4 Code Quality & Linter Cleanliness:** Resolved all unused imports, unused unpacked variables (`_graph`, `_executed_wave_3`), ambiguous variables, and type annotations (`set[str]`). Configured strict ruff linting in `pyproject.toml` with zero errors.
- **Phase 5–10 Test Integrity, Documentation & Reporting:** Verified 100% clean test execution (**226/226 tests passing**), updated `.env.example` with complete configuration keys, and authored `AUDIT_REPORT.md` in the project root.

**Outcome:** 226/226 automated tests passing (100% clean baseline), 0 ruff linter errors.
